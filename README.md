<h1 align=center><code>☠️ Death</code></h1>

**Death** is a virus targeting ELF64 binaries.   
**⚠️ Do not run this on your system. You have been warned.**

---

## 🧬 Architecture

This virus is structured in **four distinct layers**, each more complex and destructive than the last:

- **🕱 Famine**  
  The initial infection stage. A self-replicating virus that targets ELF64 binaries.

- **🦠 Pestilence**  
  The virus is now polymorphic, the infected binaries are now encrypted, and there is anti-debugging techniques.

- **⚔️ War**  
  The chaos begins. This stage introduces **metamorphic** techniques, rewriting its signature each generation.

- **💀 Death**  
  The final form. Fully metamorphic and nearly untraceable.

---

## 🧨 Entry Point

The execution starts in `famine.c`, where the infection begins.

The virus infects `/tmp/test` and `/tmp/test2`

---

## 🔓 Backdoor Daemon

A hidden **daemon** acts as a stealthy **backdoor** and provides a **remote shell**.

- If an infected binary (for example, `ls`) is executed, it can **automatically start the daemon** if it is not already running.
- The daemon silently listens in the background, awaiting remote connections.
- Upon connection, it can spawn a fully interactive **remote shell**, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised host.

This turns an infected system into a fully controlled machine, without the user's knowledge.

Running it on your own system or distributing it is **extremely dangerous and unethical**.  
Use responsibly — or not at all.
