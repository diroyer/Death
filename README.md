# ☠️ Death

**Death** is a virus targeting ELF64 binaries.  
It’s not just code — it’s a descent into digital entropy.  
**⚠️ Do not run this on your system. You have been warned.**

## 🧬 Architecture

This virus is structured in **four distinct layers**, each more complex and destructive than the last:

- **🕱 Famine**  
  The initial infection stage. A self-replicating virus that targets ELF64 binaries with surgical precision.

- **🦠 Pestilence**  
  The virus evolves. Now polymorphic, it mutates its appearance to evade signature-based detection.

- **⚔️ War**  
  The chaos begins. This stage introduces **metamorphic** techniques, rewriting its own code with each generation.

- **💀 Death**  
  The final form. Fully metamorphic and nearly untraceable, it is the apex of evolution — and destruction.

## 🧨 Entry Point

The execution starts in `famine.c`, where the infection begins.
